Hi Kunal,

I haven't had a chance to check this out yet, but for when we do go
live with this, it'd be great if you could write a blog post.  Maybe
we can even do a short video. I'm not sure how much publicity we gave
the .NET project templates, but we might want to do a combined video?

Lastly, we should update the Java client lib getting started guide and
the eclipse article we have on codesite.

Thanks much for your efforts to make it easier for developers to get
started. Much appreciated.

Cheers,
Ryan
